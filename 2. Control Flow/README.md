# Number Guessing Game

A simple command line game written in Python where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player has 5 chances to guess the correct number.

## How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess was correct or not.
- The player has a maximum of 5 attempts.
- If the player guesses correctly, they win!
- If they fail to guess in 5 tries, the correct number is revealed.
